So far, we set the groundwork to solve the puzzle, but despite all the effort, the problem is still unsolvable. Fortunately, with a few more optimizations, we will go from an impossible problem to a quick solution.

## Choice of anchor vertex
The main issue with our solution was the fact that we needed to store an enormous amount of states to make sure we didn't repeat calculations. We could try to come up with some clever algorithm to avoid keeping so many states in memory, but the underlying problem is that the search space is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in virtue of our choice of anchor vertex. This is now a good time to discuss how to choose the anchor vertex. Here are two possibilities:

1. Choosing the frame vertex with the smallest internal angle. This was my original idea, and the rationale for that was that by choosing the smallest internal angle, I'd minimize the amount of polygons that could fit into this vertex and reduce the amount of children nodes. The problem is that the resulting search space becomes a DAG and has to be searched using the procedure discussed before

2. Choose the left-most vertex in the frame. If several vertices have this property, choose the bottom-most one. Every state now has only one way to be produced, turning the search space into a tree! A standard Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm with a stack can be used to search the whole space, while the number of `State`s in memory never exceeds double digits. In our `Container`, we can get rid of the hash map, and modify the insert method to always add the new State to the end of the vector.

```c++
template <typename State>
struct Container {
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<State>> stack;
    std::shared_ptr<State> get();
    void insert(std::shared_ptr<State> state);
};

```
The puzzle is finally solvable! We get the correct answer 17152 in 300 hours. ??? But can we do better?

## Symmetry
The puzzle frame is a square, so if we know one solution, then rotating all the polygons of that solution by 90º aroudn the center of the frame produces another solution. Likewise, flipping all the polygons along the horizontal, vertical or diagonal axes also produces a solution: the puzzle has Square Dihedral Symmetry. To make use of this symmetry, we should try to generate only one minimal set of solutions from which all the others can be obtained by symmetry operations. 

Looking at a bunch of solutions, let's focus on just one of the polygons and apply symmetry operations on the solution until this polygon is as close as possible to the bottom-left section of the lower edge. It is always possible to make this polygon lie inside the triangular region. So, working backwards, we can impose that this triangle must always lie inside this region while constructing the solutions. We choose only <b>one</b> of the puzzle polygons and require that it be inside the bottom-left right triangle. A slight modification to `RestrictedPolygon' gives us that functionality:

```c++
template <typename Polygon>
struct RestrictedPolygon {
    Polygon polygon;
    std::optional<Polygon> restriction;
    unsigned int amount;
    enum transformations {Flip, Rotate, FlipRotate, None};
};
```
This brings down the computation time to ...

## Identical polygons
The eagle-eyed reader might notice that some polygons in the puzzle are actually identical, even though they have different colors. This can be exploited to save computation time. If polygons A and B are identical, then when attempting to place every possible polygon in the anchor vertex, we only need to place one of those two polygons, cutting down on the amount of children per node, and reducing the total number of solutions by a factor of two. This is why `RestrictedPolygon` has an `amount` field.
